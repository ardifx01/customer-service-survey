# Authentication System - Labbaik Chicken Customer Management

## Overview
A complete authentication system has been implemented for the Labbaik Chicken Customer Management application with hardcoded super admin credentials for initial access.

## Features
- ✅ Login page with username/password form
- ✅ Protected dashboard routes
- ✅ Persistent login sessions (localStorage)
- ✅ Logout functionality
- ✅ Automatic redirects for authenticated/unauthenticated users
- ✅ Loading states and error handling

## Login Credentials
**Super Admin Access:**
- **Username:** `superadmin`
- **Password:** `superlogin2025`

## How to Use

### 1. Accessing the Application
- Visit the application homepage (`/`)
- Click "Login Administrator" button
- You'll be redirected to `/login`

### 2. Logging In
- Enter the super admin credentials above
- Click "Masuk" to login
- Upon successful login, you'll be redirected to `/dashboard`

### 3. Dashboard Access
- All dashboard routes (`/dashboard/*`) are now protected
- Unauthenticated users will be automatically redirected to `/login`
- Authenticated users can access all dashboard features

### 4. Logging Out
- Click the "Logout" button in the admin navigation sidebar
- You'll be redirected back to the login page
- Your session will be cleared

## Technical Implementation

### Files Created/Modified:

#### New Files:
1. **`src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`** - Authentication context provider
2. **`src/app/login/page.tsx`** - Login page component
3. **`src/components/auth/AuthGuard.tsx`** - Route protection component

#### Modified Files:
1. **`src/lib/types.ts`** - Added User interface
2. **`src/app/layout.tsx`** - Added AuthProvider wrapper
3. **`src/app/page.tsx`** - Updated to redirect to login
4. **`src/app/dashboard/layout.tsx`** - Added AuthGuard protection
5. **`src/components/admin/navigation.tsx`** - Added logout functionality

### Authentication Flow:
1. User visits app → Check if logged in → Redirect accordingly
2. Login page → Validate credentials → Set user state → Redirect to dashboard
3. Dashboard access → Check authentication → Allow/Deny access
4. Logout → Clear user state → Redirect to login

### Security Features:
- Client-side authentication state management
- Route protection with automatic redirects
- Session persistence across browser refreshes
- Secure logout that clears all session data

## Future Enhancements
The current implementation uses hardcoded credentials for simplicity. For production, consider:
- Firebase Authentication integration
- Database-stored user accounts
- Role-based permissions
- Password hashing and security
- Multi-factor authentication

## Development Notes
- The authentication system is fully functional and ready for use
- No additional dependencies were required
- All components follow TypeScript best practices
- Error handling and loading states are implemented
- The system is mobile-responsive

## Testing
The system has been tested for:
- ✅ Successful login with correct credentials
- ✅ Failed login with incorrect credentials
- ✅ Protected route access
- ✅ Automatic redirects
- ✅ Session persistence
- ✅ Logout functionality
- ✅ Loading states
- ✅ Error handling
